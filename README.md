# CC4 Setup

## Steps:

1. Install Docker
2. Clone this repo  
3. Open your Windows terminal
4. Run `create.bat` once  
5. Run `start.bat` to open the container 

Then you can put your files (or clone your project repo) inside `workspace`. This folder is shared between your computer (Windows) and the Docker container (Linux).
* You can edit files from Windows using VS Code or your favorite IDE.
* You can compile and run your project from inside the Linux container.
